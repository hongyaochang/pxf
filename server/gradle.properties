# ORC versions 1.6.x have breaking changes with
# org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.ReaderImpl because
# org.apache.orc.impl.ReaderImpl removes the types property which is used to
# create the object inspector:
# this.inspector = OrcStruct.createObjectInspector(0, types);
# The types property is being restored at some point in newer (unreleased as of
# now) versions of ORC 1.6. Check when version 1.6.6 is released
